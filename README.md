# image_steganography
A GUI based program using Python
This Program deals with the secured communication between people by encrypting the secret message inside the image.
It uses LSB(least significant algorithm) for the encryption 

For running code, use  VScode of recent version and instal necessary modules like PIL , tKinter ,stegano using ur pc cmd prompt. 

Abstract:

Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding 
information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital 
images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet. For hiding secret 
information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more 
complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different 
applications have different requirements of the steganography technique used. For example, 
some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others 
require a larger secret message to be hidden. This project hides the message with in the image. 
For a more secure approach, the project it allows user to choose the bits for replacement instead 
of LSB replacement from the image. sender select the cover image with the secret text or text file 
and hide it in to the image with the bit replacement choice, it help to generate the secure stego 
image .the stego image is sent to the destination with the help of private or public 
communication network . On the other side i.e. receiver. download the stego image and using the 
software retrieve the secret text hidden in the stego image
